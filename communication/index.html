          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>We are happy to have you onboard of the next Coderefinery workshop that starts on <strong>Tuesday March 25th</strong> at 9am CET. Full schedule and details at the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/"><strong>March 2025 CodeRefinery workshop webpage</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-workshop-pre-requisites">Before the workshop: pre-requisites</h3>
<p>If you plan to participate in the hands-on exercises for this workshop, please ensure you have the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/"><strong>necessary pre-requisites prepared by visiting this link</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We provide multiple ways to learn Git: via GitHub web-interface, using the shell terminal, using VS code.</p>
<p>Using Git in the shell terminal gives you full control over your workflow, but you might not be familiar with the terminal itself. If you’d like to take advantage of Git’s full power through the command line, we offer a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/xbTTDLA3txI"><strong>shell crash course</strong></a> just before our installation session.</p>
<p>If you need assistance with the installation, we offer two help sessions on <strong>March 19th</strong> and <strong>March 24th</strong>. Please check the schedule in your time zone: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/#schedule . You can also ask someone you know for installation help - these are standard tools and they can probably give you custom advice.</p>
<p>Connection details for the installation help sessions and the shell crash course: <em>zoom link redacted</em> .</p>
<h3 id="during-the-workshop-how-to-follow">During the workshop: How-to follow</h3>
<p>Here are all relevant resources that you will need in order to connect during the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may follow the workshop lectures via Twitch in a web browser, no account needed: https://twitch.tv/coderefinery</li>
<li>Please use this collaborative document to ask questions during the workshop: https://notes.coderefinery.org/workshop-2025-march</li>
<li>Schedule and lecture materials: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/#schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>We will take a break for lunch each day, which we have done our best to schedule at a time that will work for most locations as we are across multiple time zones.</p>
<p>For those who need 1 ECTS credit, please check https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/certificates/</p>
<p>If you are attending the workshop in-person, you will receive more instructions from your local host.</p>

        <small>
          <p>Hei,</p>
<p>Thank you for offering to help with answering questions in the upcoming CodeRefinery workshop!
Your support is truly appreciated, as the shared Notes document plays a crucial role in making the workshop a valuable experience for all participants.</p>
<p>If you're new to CodeRefinery, you can find an overview of our setup here:
🔗 How to attend a CodeRefinery workshop: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/</p>
<p>For details on how we use collaborative notes, check out:
🔗 Notes documentation for participants: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/</p>
<p>How You Can Help</p>
<ul>
<li>We use a self-hosted HedgeDoc for notes (a markdown based collaborative notes editor, similar to HackMD).</li>
<li>There will be a Notes manager each day to organize and format the document. Feel free to assist them if needed.</li>
<li>If you see a question come in, answer if you can! Different viewpoints are always valuable.</li>
<li>After each day, the Notes manager will review and archive the notes—so even catching up on missed questions later is helpful.</li>
<li>Your feedback is welcome! Please share any insights or suggestions in the Notes at the end of each day.</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t have a dedicated onboarding session for Notes helpers.
You’re welcome to join our installation help sessions (see schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/#schedule) if you’d like to test things out or ask questions.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you can’t join every day or answer everything—every bit of help makes a difference!
We hope you enjoy the experience and maybe learn something new along the way.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to support@coderefinery.org.</p>
<p>Looking forward to working with you behind the scenes at the workshop!</p>
<p>Kind regards,
Samantha and the CodeRefinery organizing team</p>

          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us today!</p>
<p>You may find the archived questions and answers at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/questions/.
If you'd like to revisit some of the episodes, you may find the videos on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings are also being uploaded to our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPnR-nw8NU&amp;list=PLpLblYHCzJACpOmIzO8TywjtfYD7_d93H.</p>
<p><strong>Preparations for day 2</strong></p>
<p>Having the local editors available is good: VS Code or command line. See the second option on installation (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). If you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps you can do, and you'll learn for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Preparations for day 3</strong></p>
<p>On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.</p>
<p>If you would like to participate as individual learner in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at
https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new?template=access-request.md (there click the green button "Create" on bottom right).</p>
<p>This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.</p>
<p>After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.</p>
<p>Please accept the invitation
Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.
To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".</p>
<p><strong>Help with preparations</strong>
If you need some interactive help to make sure the tools you need are correctly setup on your computer, please join us tomorrow morning Wedneday 26/03/2025 on zoom before the stream starts at 8:00 CET, Rome (9:00 EET, Helsinki). <em>zoom link redacted</em></p>
<p><strong>How to follow the workshop</strong>
As usual the links for the following days will be:</p>

<p>Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.</p>
<p>To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".</p>
<p>That is all for today. You may find today's video on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings are also being uploaded to our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPnR-nw8NU&amp;list=PLpLblYHCzJACpOmIzO8TywjtfYD7_d93H.</p>
<p>Have a great evening!
Enrico, on behalf of the CodeRefinery team</p>
