Hi,

Thank you for joining us today!

You may find the archived questions and answers at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/questions/.
If you'd like to revisit some of the episodes, you may find the videos on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings are also being uploaded to our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPnR-nw8NU&list=PLpLblYHCzJACpOmIzO8TywjtfYD7_d93H.

**Preparations for day 2**

Having the local editors available is good: VS Code or command line. See the second option on installation (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). If you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps you can do, and you'll learn for the future.

**Preparations for day 3**

On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.

If you would like to participate as individual learner in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at 
https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new?template=access-request.md (there click the green button "Create" on bottom right).

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.

After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.

Please accept the invitation
Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.
To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".

**Help with preparations**
If you need some interactive help to make sure the tools you need are correctly setup on your computer, please join us tomorrow morning Wedneday 26/03/2025 on zoom before the stream starts at 8:00 CET, Rome (9:00 EET, Helsinki). *zoom link redacted*
