Hei, 

Thank you for offering to help with answering questions in the upcoming CodeRefinery workshop! 
Your support is truly appreciated, as the shared Notes document plays a crucial role in making the workshop a valuable experience for all participants.

If you're new to CodeRefinery, you can find an overview of our setup here:

How You Can Help

- We use a self-hosted HedgeDoc for notes (a markdown based collaborative notes editor, similar to HackMD).
- There will be a Notes manager each day to organize and format the document. Feel free to assist them if needed.
- If you see a question come in, answer if you can! Different viewpoints are always valuable.
- After each day, the Notes manager will review and archive the notesâ€”so even catching up on missed questions later is helpful.
- Your feedback is welcome! Please share any insights or suggestions in the Notes at the end of each day.

We donâ€™t have a dedicated onboarding session for Notes helpers. 
Youâ€™re welcome to join our installation help sessions (see schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-03-25-workshop/#schedule) if youâ€™d like to test things out or ask questions.

Donâ€™t worry if you canâ€™t join every day or answer everythingâ€”every bit of help makes a difference! 
We hope you enjoy the experience and maybe learn something new along the way.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to support@coderefinery.org.

Looking forward to working with you behind the scenes at the workshop!

Kind regards, 
Samantha and the CodeRefinery organizing team
