### News (day 4)

- We did the lessons as covered in the schedule.
- Tomorrow continues like today: demos, discussion, Q&A (no exercise
  or type-along).
- There is more you *can* do yourself if you install the software
  requirements (but we don't expect this, or give you time to do it).
  Consider it like homework.
- Tomorrow's topics are: Documentation (including how to document the
  way we make our lessons) and Jupyter (focus on reproducibility and
  sharing)
