### News

- Tomorrow, we continue with git from VSCode and/or the command line -
  extending today's knowledge into a way we would usually actually use
  it.  Make sure you review the installation instructions and the
  shell crash course, if necessary.
- Day 3 has special setup instructions - stay tuned for that.
