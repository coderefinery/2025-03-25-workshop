### News

- On day 3, we went over the topics as listed in the schedule and did all exercises.
- Next week: still using Git/Github, but now applying to different tasks
- Next week is all demos, no exercises (there are exercises, but too involved to fit into the day - you can do them later)
- You can definitely attend next week if you didn't this week - if you know git, you can follow it all.  If not, you'll see ideas you can study more and apply later.
