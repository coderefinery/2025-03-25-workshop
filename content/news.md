### News (day 4)

- We covered the lessons as shown in the schedules.  All demos, you
  can do more later.
- Tomorrow we have: testing (practical, still a demo but has real
  exercises you can do later), and moduloar code development (this is
  a demo + discussion - you see ous go from Jupyter to a reusable
  program.  Very cool stuff.)
- Don't forget the "bring your own code" sessions where you can get
  more help with your own work, or more Q&A on the lesson topics.
